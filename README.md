# React - Redux Database Display
This is a database display in the front-end that can be created using JSON files,searched for particular values and updated to the back-end database.(In general)

This database is of currencies of all countries. A button is given so that one can verify whehter one has the particular currency in his/her collection.

The "NC" stands for notes and coins denoting both have been issued by the country. 

Any database can be added by changing the JSON file and updating the related fields in the files.

The back-end database has not been linked. It is left to the user, whether he/she wants to save the changes. For that, a database can be established and the app can be linked, so that the database gets updated for every button click.
